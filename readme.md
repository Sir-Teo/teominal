# Teonominal: A Fake Terminal for Viewing Resumes

Teonominal is a playful, **single-page web application** that simulates a file-system and terminal environment using [xterm.js](https://xtermjs.org/). Users can run common shell commands like `ls`, `cat`, `cd`, and more—all inside their browser. This version runs here https://sir-teo.github.io/teominal/

## Features

- **Interactive Commands**: `ls`, `cat`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `pwd`, `echo`, `date`, `readlocal`, and `clear`  
- **Simulated File System**: A simple object-based “file system” for demonstration

## Getting Started

1. **Clone or Download** this repository.
2. **Open** the `index.html` file in your preferred browser.
3. Start typing commands in the terminal!
